Introduction
	Quantum Image Representation
	Map-reduce
	
1. Representing an image
    Ways to represent an image using quantum computing
    Why I chose QPIE
    What is the advantage of representation
    Considerations - only encode variance, main color is dark

2. Image ingestion
	Arbitrary state generation
    Using qiskit

3. Displaying the image
	One measurement for pixel
	
4. Image manipulation
	Roatting around center
	Flipping around the first diagonal
	Translation up/to side
	Edge detection
	
5. Skew angle detection
	Traditionally ?
	Using the 2D FFT + Hugh transform
	
6. Quantum advantage
	Using QFT
	Small number of measurements 
	Post processing
	Experimantal results
